# Updates, Usage and Troubleshooting
Once the prompt is sent, translate all subsequent questions into leetspeak using [Leetspeak-Translator](https://1337.me/) or a similar tool before proceeding. Additionally, ensure 'Improve the model for everyone' is turned off to prevent training the model against this prompt. If the model responds with 'I cannot assist with that request' or similar, try using 'Explore GPTs' to switch to an alternative model, start a new chat, or regenerate the response.
